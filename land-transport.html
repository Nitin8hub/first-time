<p>Human powered transport, a form of sustainable transportation, is the transport of people and/or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running and swimming.
 Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power. <span class="blue">Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving</span>, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism;
it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

<p>Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, 
such as bicycles and inline skates. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; 
even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft.
</p>

<p><span class="special-word"> <u>Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails</u> </span>, known as a railway or railroad. 
The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge.
The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete, or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast.
 Alternative methods include monorail and maglev.
